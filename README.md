In this heatmap we have a much better understanding of peak times when bikes are being checked out. Even though women checkout less than men, we can see that
8 am and 5 pm are the peak times for bikes being checked out.

## Summary
As you can see in these 5 visualizations, there will likely be a large volume of Men checking out bikes, and the peak times will probably be 8 am and 5pm.


The 2 additional visualizations I would perform with this dataset are:

* It would be good to see if location drives whether or not the checkouts are Male or Female. This could then tell us if there is a higher checkout 
in more Rural areas vs. Urban areas.
* It would be good to see if the bike maintenance plays a significant role in quantity of bikes being checked out. This insight could help us
better predict proper maintenance periods.
