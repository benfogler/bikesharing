In this line graph you can see the largest quantity of riders have bikes checked out for no more than ~5 minutes.


**Snapshot of Short-Term vs. Long-Term**

![customer_vs_subscriber](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/114610539/214150275-13560b87-3ad6-4879-8f42-9863e0f05fac.png)


In this pie chart you can see the volume of checkouts are by subscribers, which yeilds a better consistency when assuming monetary metrics.


**Gender Breakout**

In this pie chart you can see that the majority of users are Male. Understanding this information further will help determine advertising campaigns.


**Checkout Times by Gender**

In this 3 part line-chart you can see that regardless of Male or Female, the common length of bikes being checked out is 5 minutes.


**Male vs. Female hourly Heatmap**

In this heatmap we have a much better understanding of peak times when bikes are being checked out. Even though women checkout less than men, we can see that
8 am and 5 pm are the peak times for bikes being checked out.

## Summary
As you can see in these 5 visualizations, there will likely be a large volume of Men checking out bikes, and the peak times will probably be 8 am and 5pm.


The 2 additional visualizations I would perform with this dataset are:

* It would be good to see if location drives whether or not the checkouts are Male or Female. This could then tell us if there is a higher checkout 
in more Rural areas vs. Urban areas.
* It would be good to see if the bike maintenance plays a significant role in quantity of bikes being checked out. This insight could help us
better predict proper maintenance periods.
